# Safety concepts

EB corbos Linux for Safety Applications (EBcLfSA) is the safety-dedicated SDK built on top of EB corbos Linux.

EBcLfSA allows you to build high integrity (HI) applications that can communicate securely between them, or with the rest of the low integrity (LI) system.

Key concepts of EBcLfSA include the HI supervisor, the Health Monitor, and shared memory communication.

You can refer to the following chapters to learn more about safety developments within EB corbos Linux/EBcLfSA:
